Hey! I am Omer Shalev , a 17 Y/O from Israel . I'm a computer science student at The open University of Israel, staring my third year soon.  I am interested on cyber security and exploitation stuff. I like to solve info-sec challenges , participate in CTFs  and find vulnerabilities in real world products.
